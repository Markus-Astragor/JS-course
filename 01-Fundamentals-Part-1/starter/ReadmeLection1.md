## Console.log() method

if you want to write in script tag sth like this 48+30 --> nothing
why? 
because you didn't tell where js should display this result
if you write console.log(48+30) -> 78

## Naming variables

They should be easy to understand, decricable

They shouldn't contain numbers signs, keywords('function, new, var, let and so on...') and so on. They only can containd dollar sign, underscore and letters.
In js you should use camelCase because it is approved in js world. If we talk about ruby here is used snake_case 

! Don't use just name in creating variables. It allows you but it can create some problems always be aware of it
