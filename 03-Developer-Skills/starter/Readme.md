## Solving problems

if you want to become a great developer you need to think as a developer so that's why you need to learn how to deal with problems.

To fix that here is an algorhitm:

1. Stay calm and slow down, don't just jump at a problem without a plan.
2. Take a very logical and rational approach (programming is just about a logic, in the end)

### Four-step framework

1. Make sure you 100% undestand the problem. Ask the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem.
   Ask questions if you don't understand sth in order to know exactly what you need to implement.
2. Divide and conquer. Break problem into smaller sub-problems.
   For instance your project manager came to you and say: "We need a function which reverses whatever we pass into it"
   Sub-problems:

**1. Check if argument is a string, array or a number 2. Implement reversing a number 3. Implement reversing a string 4. Implement reversing an array 5. Return the values
**
